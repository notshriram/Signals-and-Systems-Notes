Signals can be used to describe a wide range of natural phenomena. A signal is generally imagined as a pattern of variations of some quantity with respect to another independent quantity. In the following section we shall look into the definition of a signal as well as a system along with some examples

\section{Introduction} 

\begin{description}
	\item[Signal] It is defined as a function of any independent variable. Generally speaking, a signal is a function of time which conveys some sort of information.\\
\textbf{E.g;}
\begin{itemize}
\item Speech or Voice signals
\item Image signals 
\item etc
\end{itemize}
\item[System] It is a collection of objects which work together to perform a particular task\\
From a communications standpoint, systems are used to process signals.
\end{description}

\section{Classification of Signals}
If a signal is defined in terms of only one independent variable, it is called a one dimensional signal otherwise it is called a multi-dimensional signal.\\
in addition to dimensions,signals can be classified on the basis of various parameters:
\subsection*{\Large{On the basis of time $t$}}
\textbf{Continuous Time Signals}\\
A signal which is defined continuously for all values of time $t$ is called a continuous time signal. It is represented by $x(t)$ (in parentheses) and are also called analog signals.

{\bf Discrete Time Signals}\\ A signal that is defined for only specific instances of time or at discrete values of time.It is represented by $x[n]$ (in brackets).It is generally obtained by sampling an analog signal.\\

{\bf These signals can be further classified as follows:}
\subsection*{\Large{On the basis of periodicity}}
\textbf{Periodic Signals :}
{\bf Continuous Time Periodic Signals }\\
a signal is said to be CT-periodic if it repeats after a certain time interval $T_0$\\
Mathematically, it is defined as the signal which satisfies :\\
\begin{align*}
x(t)=x(t+T_0)  \forall  t  \in R
\end{align*}
{\bf Discrete Time Periodic Signals }\\
a signal is said to be DT-periodic if it repeats after a certain time interval $N_0$\\
Mathematically, it is defined as the signal which satisfies :\\
\begin{align*}
x[n]=x[n+N_0]  \forall  n  \in Z
\end{align*}
{\bf Aperiodic Signals :}\\ A signal that does not satisfy the above conditions is called aperiodic signal. It may be viewed as a limiting case of a periodic signal in which period tends to Infinity.
\subsection*{\Large{Even and Odd signals }}
	a signal $x(t)$ is said to be even if it satisfies :
	\begin{align*}
	x(t)=x(-t){\hspace{4mm}(CT)}\\
	x[n]=x[-n]{\hspace{4mm}(DT)}
	\end{align*}
	a signal x(t) is said to be odd if it satisfies :
	\begin{align*}x(t)=-x(-t){\hspace{4mm}(CT)}\\x[n]=-x[-n]{\hspace{4mm}(DT)}\end{align*}	
	if it satisfies neither it is said to be neither even nor odd.\\

\subsection*{\Large{Deterministic and Random Signals }}
A signal is said to be deterministic if there is no uncertainty with respect to its value at any instant of time. Or, signals which can be defined exactly by a mathematical formula are known as deterministic signals.\\

A signal is said to be non-deterministic if there is uncertainty with respect to its value at some instant of time. Non-deterministic signals are random in nature hence they are called random signals. Random signals cannot be described by a mathematical equation. They are modelled in probabilistic terms.\\
\subsection*{\Large{Energy and Power Signals }}
A signal is said to be energy signal when it has finite energy.
$$\text{Energy}\, E = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |x\,(t)|^2dt$$
A signal is said to be power signal when it has finite power.
$$\text{Power}\, P = \lim_{T \to \infty}\,{1\over2T}\,\int_{-T}^{T}\,|x(t)|^2dt$$
NOTE:A signal cannot be both, energy and power simultaneously. Also, a signal may be neither energy nor power signal.

Power of energy signal = 0\\
Energy of power signal =$\infty$

\section{Standard Signals}
There are some standard signals which are used repeatedly in signals and systems. Let us take a look on some of them.\vspace{4mm}\\
{\bf Standard signals list:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unit step signal
\item Unit Ramp signal
\item Unit parabolic
\item Signum
\item Real And Complex Exponential Signals
\item Sinusoidal Signals
\item Rectangular Signals
\item Triangular signal
\item Sampling Function
\item Sinc Function
\item Gaussian Pulse
\item Unit Impulse
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Unit step signal}
for continuous time :\\
	\[ x(t) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}

	1 & \mbox{if $t > 0$;} \\

	0 & \mbox{if $t < 0$;} \\

	\end{array}
	\right. \]
at t=0 there is a discontinuity. but generally it can be said that the value converges to 0.5

Here is how to define things in the proper mathematical style.
Let $f_k$ be the $AND-OR$ function, defined by

\[ f_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{2^k}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}

	x_1 & \mbox{if $k = 0$;} \\

	AND(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))
	 & \mbox{if $k$ is even;} \\

	OR(f_{k-1}(x_1, \ldots, x_{2^{k-1}}),
	   f_{k-1}(x_{2^{k-1} + 1}, \ldots, x_{2^k}))	
	& \mbox{otherwise.} 
	\end{array}
	\right. \]
